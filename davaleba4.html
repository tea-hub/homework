 <h2>georgian rtveli</h2>
<p class="note">
  Rtveli (Georgian: რთველი) is a traditional vintage and rural harvest holiday in Georgia accompanied by feasts, musical events and other celebrations. It normally takes place in late September in eastern Georgia and in mid-October in western Georgia.
In Georgia, where wine has an iconic significance, the tradition of rtveli dates back to ancient times, having its roots in the festivity of mid-Autumn abundance and variety. Rtveli usually lasts for several days, with people starting working in early morning hours and ending the day with a feast in the accompaniment of vintage-themed folk songs.[1][2][3]
